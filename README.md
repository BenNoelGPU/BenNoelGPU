Hello! My name is Ben Noel (@BenNoelGPU, 
He/Him), im a CCSU student majoring is
Computer Science and Engineering with a 
focus in Software Engineering.

After spending the last 4 years learning
in Java and Python and building a verbose
history in customer service, I now write
code to debug AAA games and create more
accessible UI.

Im interested in creating a much faster,
smoother user experience while discovering
new and efficient ways to rewrite old code.
